# Adapter design pattern

Repository with source code of the examples used in the classes about the design pattern Adapter, taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at UNIFAL-MG.

## Examples


### 01 - Weapon Game

In this example, I demonstrate the use of the Adapter Design Pattern in order to use a third-party class in our weapon game. We don't have the source code of the third-party classs (but we have the Java doc). In addition to that, we don't want to change our Weapon interface to not break all of our classes that implement that interface. The third party class represents a ShotGun to be used by our game Character.
